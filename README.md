# To Wear

### ToWear is an application that suggests outfits to users from their closets based on the weather. We aim to use linear regression to personalize the results to each user. [Check out the current state of the app here](http://oamandawi.pythonanywhere.com/).

## The main ideas of the app -- for users and for developers: <a name="ideas"></a>

### 1. For Users <a name="ideas_user"></a>
        We want our users to provide as little inputs as possible because we believe that will give them a better experience using the app.
    
        You only have to create your closet based on the clothes you have. Each garment has a score from 1 to 10 to
    specify the warmth. Each garment warms one of four parts of the body: (1) head, (2) top, (3) bottom, (4) feet.
        
        You can then ask for a suggestion and you will be given a suggested outfit based on the current weather
    outside.
    
        If desired, you can give the app information every day about what you wore and how you felt. This will be compared to the weather outside for that given day; the next time you ask for a suggestion, you will get more personalized outfits.
